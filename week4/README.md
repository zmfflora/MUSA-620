# MUSA620-Week-4
Twitter API ([notes](https://github.com/MUSA-620-Fall-2017/MUSA-620-Week-4/blob/master/week-4-twitter.pptx))


# Assignment

Since some of you are still finishing up your web scrapers, and because we didn't get much beyond a broad overview of Twitter, there will be no assignment this week. We will pick the Twitter API back up again when we get to the sentiment analysis portion of the course.
