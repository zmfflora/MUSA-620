**MUSA 620: Data Wrangling and Data Visualization**

**SCHEDULING**

Class: Wednesdays from 9am to 12pm. Office hours: Mondays from 1pm to 5pm, by appointment (galkamaxd at gmail).

				
**OBJECTIVE**

The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the “pipeline” approach to data science. This involves the process of gathering data, storing the data, analyzing the data, and visualizing the data such that non-technical decision makers can make sense of it. The course is broken down accordingly into four sections.

1.	**Data collection**: Students will learn how to gather data by way of web scraping, APIs, and other unstructured sources.
2.	**Databases**: This part of the course teaches students how to store this data for efficient retrieval and analysis.
3.	**Analytics**: Students will learn a range of machine-driven techniques for analyzing structured and unstructured data.
4.	**Data visualization**: The last part of the course teaches students how to present the results of their analysis visually using R and the web application framework Shiny.
	
**FORMAT**

The course will be conducted in weekly sessions devoted to lectures, demonstrations and discussions.


**ASSIGNMENTS**

There is one required final project at the end of the semester. Homework will be assigned before the close of each class and will be due at the end of the following week’s class. Four of the homework assignments will be explicitly required. The remainder are optional, but will count toward the participation component of your final grade.

For the final project, students will replicate the pipeline approach on a dataset (or datasets) of their choosing. The final deliverable will be a web-based data visualization and accompanying description including a summary of the results and the methods used in each step of the process (collection, storage, analysis and visualization). 


**GRADING**

The grading breakdown is as follows: 50% for homework; 40% for final project, 10% for participation


**SOFTWARE**

This course relies on use of the R Statistical Package in conjunction with Shiny and other associated extensions.
